# Greedy Algorithms

A "greedy" algorithm is a type of algorithm where you build the solution piece by piece. It sets a rule for
which elements to add to the solution at each step in the algorithm. This could be minimizing a cost or maximizing a
count for instance. The algorithm continues step-by-step evaluating elements based on the rule until it reaches the 
end of it's input data. 

Sometimes, this doesn't always find the correct solution. Only certain problems can be solved by greedy algorithms.

There are two propeties needed in order for a greedy algorithm to be used to solve a problem: 
1. __Greedy choice__: A global (or overall) optimal solution can be found by selecting the optimal solution at each step in the algorithm.
2. __Optimal substructure__: An optimal substructure exists if an optimal soltion to the entire problem contains the 
optimal soltions to all sub-problems. 

Greedy algorithms only work on problems where at every step, there is a choice that is optimal for the problem up to that step, and after the final step, 
the algorithm produces the optimal solution of the complete problem. 

Read that a few times if it doesn't make sense. 

## Example: 

Let's create a change machine that takes in a given amount of money and returns the amount separated into as few coins as possible. 
This should be returned as a list of coins which sum to the amount. 

```java
public class ChangeMachine {
    public static  ArrayList<Integer> getMinCoins(int amount)  {
        
    }
}
```

Right away you see the rule for this problem: the minimum number of coins must be used when making change for the input amount. 

Now let's say the coins available to us are quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies. So we'd have these options:

```java
private static final int[] coins = { 25, 10, 5, 1 };
```

Say our amount is 37 cents. How would we go about generating the change? Pretty simply, we could start with the largest coin and subtract it
from the amount. If at any step, the amount is less than a coin value, then we move to a smaller coin. We repeat, subtracting from the 
amount until the amount is 0. 

So for 37 cents, we'd subtract the largest coin, 25, and add the 25 to our results list. Then amount would
be 12. 12 is less than 25 so we'd need to move to our next smaller coin, the dime. Subtracting 10 from 12 and we get 2. 2 is less than 10 and
also less than 5, so we move to the penny. 2 pennies can be used to make 2 cents. Thus we're left with ` [25, 10, 1, 1]` for our change. 

Is this a greedy algorithm? It is. Look at each step in the algorithm. At each step, we take the largest coin possible that fits into our amount. We
can do this at every step. And once we get to the last step, the resulting array of change is actually the optimal solution to the entire problem. So
both greedy choice and optimal substrucutre are present. 

Let's see the solution: 

```java
public class ChangeMachine {
    public static int [] coins = {25, 10, 5, 1}; 

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int amount = 37;
        System.out.println(amount + " cents can be broken into the minimum number of coins as: " + getMinCoins(amount));
    }

    public static  ArrayList<Integer> getMinCoins(int amount)  {       
      ArrayList<Integer> change = new ArrayList<Integer>();
      int i = 0;
      while (i < coins.length) {    
        int coin = coins[i];        
        if (coin <= amount) {       
          amount = amount - coin;   
          change.add(coin);         
        } else {
          i++;                     
        }
      }
      return change;      
    }
}
```

Output would be
```bash
37 cents can be broken into the minimum number of coins as: [25, 10, 1, 1]
```

There you have a greedy algorithm. The above solution uses esentially a nested while loop, so our runtime complexity would be O(n^2) 
where n is the number of available coins. We can actually solve this problem more efficiently, using Dynamic Programming--the next algorithm
we'll look at.

At this point you may be thinking: "Wait a second, what about sorting and searching algorithms". Since sorting and
searching are so important in software development, I felt that these algorithms deserved their own posts. Check them out for a
