Deisgn patterns are tools that developers can use when designing distributed applications. Today, we'll look at a few well known design patterns
and how they're implemented in Java. 

## Builder Pattern

The intent of the builder pattern is to separate the construction of a complext object from its representation
such that the same construction process can create different representations. It's essentially an abstraction that 
creates a more flexible object creation interface. 

__What problem does it solve?__

Think about constructors in Java. If I want to make a object via the obnjects constructor, the constructor has to be 
declared and take the fields of the object as parameters. For example, the Product constructor needs parameters for 
each of its fields. 

```java

public class Product {


  private String id;
  private String name;
  private double price; 
  private String description; 

  public Product(String id) {
    this.id = id;
  }

  public Product(String id, String name) {
    this.id = id;
    this.name = name;
  }

  public Product(String id, String name, double price) {
    this.id = id;
    this.name = name;
    this.price = price;
  }

  // getters, setters, object methods
}

```

Notice that for different representations of a Product we need multiple contructors, each with a varying 
number of parameters. When the parameter number gets large, say 4+, then it can become difficult 
to remember which parameters are required and in what order when constructing an object. 
This is known as the [Telescoping Constructor Anti-pattern](http://www.captaindebug.com/2011/05/telescoping-constructor-antipattern.html#.X7NUvhNKh_k) and is what the builder pattern 
was made to solve. 

The builder pattern decouple object creation and allows for a fluid object creation syntax where the same
object creation mechanism can create different represetnations of the same object. 

```java

public class Product {

  private String id;
  private String name;
  private double price; 
  private String description; 

  private Product(ProductBuilder builder) {
    this.id = builder.id;
    this.name = builder.name;
    this.price = builder.price;
    this.description = builder.description;
  }

  public static class ProductBuilder {

    private String id;
    private String name;
    private double price; 
    private String description; 

    public ProductBuilder builder() {
      return this;
    }

    public ProductBuilder id(String id) {
      this.id = id;
      return this;
    }

    public ProductBuilder name(String name) {
      this.name = name;
      return this;
    }

    public ProductBuilder price(double price) {
      this.price = price;
      return this;
    }

    public ProductBuilder description(String description) {
      this.description = description
    }

    public static Product build() {
      return new Product(this);
    }
  }
}
```

The above can be used as: 

```java

Product mac = ProductBuilder.builder()
    .id("123")
    .name("Macbook")
    .price(949.99)
    .description("A sleek, fast, shiny, 15 inch Macbook Pro computer.")
    .build();

Product pc = ProductBuilder.builder()
    .id("456")
    .name("Personal Computer")
    .price(549.99)
    .description("A boring computer created by Microsoft.")
    .build();

System.out.println("You can buy a " + pc.getName() + "or a " + mac.getName);
```

Notice that you can leave fields out in the builder pattern while using the same builder. 

Now, you may say "well thats a lot of bopiler pl"

## Data Access Object

A data access object is meant to provide an abstract interface to some tupe of database or other persistence mechanism. It's intention is to define the API to a datastore
without implementing the datastore. Then, the data access interface can be implemented elsehwere or in multiple different ways. This provides flexibility to an 
application's architecture. 

__Example__

A real world example: There is a set of products that need to be saved in a datastore for my e-commerce application. In addition, I'll need an entire set of create, read, write, and remove 
operations so that my application can interact with my products. In this example, a data access object can be created to define the API for interacting with these products. 

Below is my product entity which i want to persist and interact with using CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations.

```java
import lombok.Data;

@Data
public class Product {

  private String id;
  private String name;
  private double price; 
  private String description; 

}

```

My data access object would look like the below: 

```java

public interface ProductDataAccess {

  Stream<Product> getAll();

  Optional<Product> getProductById(String id);

  Product updateProduct(Product product);

  void deleteProductById(String id);
}
```

The Data Access interface can then be implemented in multiple ways. 

```java

public class InMemoryProductRepository implements ProductDataAccess {

  private final Map<String, Product> inMemoryProductStore = new HashMap<>();

  Stream<Product> getAll() {
    return inMemoryProductStore.values().stream();
  }

  Optional<Product> getProductById(String id) {
    return inMemoryProductStore.get(id);
  }

  Product updateProduct(Product product) {
    inMemoryProductStore.set(product.getId(), product);
    return inMemoryProductStore.get(product.getId());
  }

  void deleteProductById(String id) {
    inMemoryProductStore.set(id, null);
  }
}

public class ProductSQLRepository implements ProductDataAccess {

  private final DataStore dataStore;

  public ProductRepository(DataStore dataStore) {
    this.dataStore = dataStore;
  }

  // Implement methods using SQL data store
}

public class ProductMongoDbRepository implements ProductDataAccess {

  private final MongoRepository dataStore;

  public ProductRepository(MongoRepository dataStore) {
    this.dataStore = dataStore;
  }

  // Implement methods using MongoRepository data store. 
}

```

__Value__ 

This is where the beauty of the Data Access Object comes in. It allows the application to define as an interface the operations that the application needs in order to
interact with its entities. Then the actual persistence mechanism can be implemented in any way possible, as long as the implementation conforms to the API. 

This is powerful. Think of a brand new project that you're working on. The requirements are vague, the data model is not quite hashed out. How do you make a decision
on a data store at this time? Should you use a relational model or NoSQL? What database offerings will provide you the best performance for your data? The answer
is: you don't know. And a data access interface allows you to delay that decision as long as you'd like because you can implement the data access with any implementation you
like. Early in the project, simply use an in-memory map. As your application evolves you may see relational cahracteristics emerge--so switch to a SQL database. Further 
down the road, you may find your assumptions were wrong and that a document store is more efficient. The change is easy. You can create another implementation alongside 
your existing implementation, test and verify its efficacy, and then switch the implmentation with a single line code change. 

Not only that, but a Data Access Object consolidates the point of data layer access to one class. It allows you to clearly define how your application will interact with 
the data layer, making your code more understandable and maintainable. 

This is extremely powerful and shows the benefit of clearly defining interfaces in your application code. It also leads into Dependency Inversion and the Hexagonal Architecture, 
topics which I cover in other articles. 

## Abstract Factory Pattern 

The goal of the abstract factory pattern is to have an interface for creating groups of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. This 
interface acts as a factory for creating objects without having to be fully dependent on the concrete impmentations of the objects themselves. 

### Example: 
wip...
### Class diagram: 
wip...
### When to use it? 

The abstract fatory pattern is applicable when: 
- you need a run-time value to construct a particular dependency.

taken from my career as a software engineer. You can also find a useful overview of widely used java design patterns at [java-design-patterns.com](https://java-design-patterns.com/patterns/).
